## Description

This is the code for a Recommender System. The code uses the lightfm recommender system library to train a hybrid content-based + collaborative algorithm that uses the WARP loss function on the movielens dataset.  Once trained, our script prints out recommended movies for whatever users from the dataset that we choose to terminal.
